## üê¶ About me

**Salute** to the distinguished guests from the World Wide Web. I am a machine learning enthusiast, computer science adept and even plant breeder with more than two decades of a wide range experience.
I am interested in the unusual application of **Cybernetic**|**Hybrid**|**Genetic** algorithms and architectures for a better future for all humanity.
In addition to my research, I am interested in experimenting with **complex mergers** of neural network models and training them. You may have heard about my **evolutionary method** of infinite loop model inference and some other unusual concepts in computer science that I have publicly discussed.

<details>
  <summary>My journey began with experiments in Basic and Pascal, moving on to many other programming languages from university studies to commercial employment and private projects</summary>

* Pascal/Delphi, C99, C++98, ASM, Prolog, C#, Java, PHP, ActionScript, JavaScript. It is difficult to imagine a student of a technical university who does not know half of this, but I am glad that in my experience the knowledge base was quite wide and based on such interesting technologies.
* PHP/JS were once a big part of the web and my interest in it led to the use of these languages both in some educational moments and at my first job.
* Java seemed to be almost a real killer of C++, and with OpenGL and JNI it was possible to create performance-compatible video games. Of course, with a programmable pipeline and shaders. I don't remember if Minecraft was already there or not, but this is a good example of the success of such a concept.
* Efficient, clean and simple C[99,11], as well as the whole universe of C++ madness [98,11,14,17,20,23]. It attracts me from time to time, but knowing all this at a decent level is difficult for an employee and expensive for an employer, although the latest C++ standards make me happy. For me, these two languages, which are very similar in history, partially compatible in different years, but conceptually completely different, are the two grails of love and hate. The C language is about performance and unambiguity of the code, minimalism and conciseness of the language model. Yes, it is already archaic in some ways, but there are much more advantages in it. And those that are sometimes unattainable neither in Python, nor in Rust, nor in C++. I have met talented developers who prefer C and create serious 3dEngine-like projects or cool libraries on it. But this is rare and more often it is some microcontroller-like projects or linux/gcc-based open source.
* Three completely different but interesting languages - Python, Go and Rust. Each of them has its own areas of applicability, which now allow you to build your code base and business entirely on them and bypass competitors in the long run. And they are my focus now.
